# Tiny Habits
### Question 1
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea is that to achieve your goal, there is no need to start big from the get-go. Start a tiny habit that helps you work towards the goal and practice it every day with a good level of motivation and with a proper trigger i.e. after what you would do that habit and celebrate each time you would do the habit.

### Question 2
How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?

M - Motivation

A - Ability

P - Prompt

It forms a curve which goes from high to low and to do any habit you require the prompt to be above the action line.

To develop new habits you need,
- Right motivation to do it
- Ability to do the habit
- Prompt to trigger the habit

As tough habits require a high level of motivation so it is above the action line, it is not recommended to start doing it from day one i.e., for example, to get fit don't start by doing 100 push-ups from the first day because you require high motivation and may not continue with the habit.

Instead, start by developing a tiny habit that is easy to do and requires less motivation, and that helps you attain your goal. Then, repeat the tiny habit after an action which goes hand in hand with the tiny habit i.e. After I wake up, I will do one push-up.

### Question 3
Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
- To get motivated to do it again
- Make it fun
- Helps to do it more often
- Take it to the next level
- Makes it meaningful
- Becomes a routine

### Question 4
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Story of Dave Brailsford and British Cycling is interesting as how a unsuccessful team rise to winning 70% of the gold medals available by doing small incremental change. To achieve something big can be daunting at first but doing something as low as 1% each day to achieve it leads you to your destiny.

- Celebrate with immediate rewards
- Keep it simple at first and increase it by 1% daily
- Reduce friction for good habits
- Focus on systems to achieve it rather than goals
- Be in an environment which supports the habit
- Try to stack it with existing habits

### Question 7
Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

- Increase friction for the bad habit
- Do not be in an environment which supports it
- Know the consequences of the habit and avoid it
- Make it hard to do by limiting the availability
- Take help from others if needed to warn you when you do the habit

### Question 8:
Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

The habit of exercising
- Develop a tiny habit of doing a push when I wake up in the morning and progressively increasing the number
- Take a photo in front of the mirror every day and be happy about the progress even if it is not visible
- Hear music while I am exercising
- Gamify it by curating a list of exercises as daily challenges and some additional optional challenges and keep track of the points I accumulate daily

### Question 9:
Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

The habit of sleeping late
- Develop a tiny habit of switching off my mobile after 11 pm so it becomes unattractive to remain awake at night
- Feel bad in the morning if I sleep late
- Not sleep all day so it becomes hard to stay awake at night and sleep early
