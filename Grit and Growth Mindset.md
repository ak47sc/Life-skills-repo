# Grit and Growth Mindset

#### Question 1
**Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines. Use your own words.**

The video emphasises that success is not only determined by the IQ of students but also dependent on grit. Grit is defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, which is a key predictor of success in education. One should cultivate a growth mindset and never think of failure as the end; it is a part of learning towards growth.

#### Question 2
**Paraphrase (summarize) the video in a few (1 or 2) lines in your own words**

The video explains the concept of a growth mindset, developed by Carol Dweck. It explains that a fixed mindset can cut one from going out of one's safe zone and not allow to improve oneself in the fear of failure, and challenges and react defensively to feedback. In contrast, people with a growth mindset will challenge themself, learn from their mistakes, and implement constructive feedback, leading to greater achievement over time. Focusing on developing this growth mindset will go a long way toward a flexible nature and thrive in different environments.

#### Question 3
**What is the Internal Locus of Control? What is the key point in the video?**

Internal locus of control is a belief which makes individuals understand that their actions have consequences, either good or bad. They don't blame external forces for their failure or success. They take responsiblity for thier own actions, decisions, and efforts.

The key point is to develop an internal locus of control where individuals blame themself for their actions and try to rectify them to attain success. One should acknowledge their efforts led to improvement and cultivate a sense of control over thier actions.
