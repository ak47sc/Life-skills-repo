# REST Architecture Technical Paper
## 1. Introduction
- REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.
- It is a software archtectural style which defines set of rules for creating web services.
- It follows a uniform and predefined set of rules to access the system and manipulate web resouces.
- Restful system consists of :
  - client requesting resources
  - Server providing resouces

## 2. Architectural Constraints of RESTful API
It consists of six architectural constraints that makes any web service. There are :
- Uniform Interface
- Stateless
- Cacheable
- Client-Server
- Layered System
- Code on Demand

### 2.1 Uniform Interface
- It is a key constraints which makes it unique to Non-REST API.
- The idea it that there should be uniform way of interacting with server irrespective of the application

There are four main guildlines needs to be followed:
- **Resource-Based** : Resources are uniquely identified by URIs. Example: /api/features, /api/products
- **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations** : Users get a unique representation of the resouces and contains sufficent information to modify or delete the resouces, provided it has relavent permissions. For example, a user gets a user ID when logged in and can use it to modify or delete its user credentials.
- **Self-descriptive Messages** : Request contains enough information for processing the request.
- **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)** : It need to include links for each response so that client can discover other resources easily.

### 2.2 Stateless 
- Stateless means the request are independent and the server handles each request separately without any pior knowledge of the client. So request must contain all the information to fulfill the request.
- It helps to enable greater availability since the server does not have to maintain, update or communicate that session state.

### 2.3 Cacheable
- Requests are requied to annouce if it is cacheable or not and their duration it can be cached at the client side. This allows the client to return the data from the cache for any subsequent requests and no need of sending requests again to the server.
- It helps to improve performance as it reduces some clientâ€“server interactions.

### 2.4 Client-Server
- REST application requies a client-server architecture.
- Client is the someone who requies resouces and a server is the one who provides the resouces.
  
### 2.5 Layered System
- REST applications are composed of multiple layers without knowing each other except their immediate layer.
- This decouples the client from the backend, enabling scalability and flexibility.
### 2.6 Code on Demand
- The server can send executable code (like JavaScript) to the client, which then can be executed by the client.
- This constraint is optional.

## 3 Common HTTP Methods Used in REST
- **GET** : Retrieves resouces from the server and can cache the information. Example: getting list of products.
- **POST** : Creates new resource with the information provided in the request and it is not cacheable.
- **PUT** : Updates an existing resource with an ID specified in the request.
- **DELETE** : Deletes an existing resource specified in the request.

## 4 Some REST API interactions
1. **GET/products** :
   - Retrives a list of products.
   - Response example :
     ```
       [
         {
           "id":1,
           "name":"coke",
           "price":30
         }
       ,
         {
           "id":2,
           "name":"lays",
           "price":10
         }
      }
     ```
2. **GET/products/2** :
   - Retrives product with ID 2.
   - Response example :
     ```
     {
       "id":2,
       "name":"lays",
       "price":10
     }
     ```
3. **POST/products** :
   - Creates a new product by sending a request with the data in the body.
   - Request example :
     ```
     {
       "name":"dairy milk",
       "price":20
     }
     ```
   - Response Example :
     ```
     201 Created
     ```
4. **PUT/products/1** :
   - Updates the product with ID 1.
   - Request example :
     ```
     {
       "name":"dairy milk",
       "price":25
     }
     ```
   - Response Example :
     ```
     200 OK
     ```
5. **DELETE/products/2** :
   - Deletes product with ID 2.
   - Response Example :
     ```
     204 No Content
     ```

## 5 Advantages of REST
- **Scalability**
- **Interoperability**
- **Simplicity**
- **Statelessness**

## 6 Disadvantages of REST
- **Lack of state**
- **Lack of security**
- **Less reliable**
- **Incompatibility with real-time functionality**

## 7 Conclusion
REST provides a scalable, simple and flexible architectural style for building web services. By adhering to its principles, developers can create APIs which are performant, easy to maintain and can integrate with other systems. REST has been widly adopted in modern web development for building APIs due to its simplicity and scalability.
