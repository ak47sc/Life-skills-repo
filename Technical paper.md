# REST Architecture Technical Paper
## 1. Introduction
- REST stands for **Representational State Transfer**.
- It is a software archtectural style which defines set of rules for creating web services.
- It follows a uniform and predefined set of rules to access the system and manipulate web resouces.
- Restful system consists of :
  - client requesting resources
  - Server providing resouces

## 2. Architectural Constraints of RESTful API
It consists of six architectural constraints that makes any web service. There are :
- Uniform Interface
- Stateless
- Cacheable
- Client-Server
- Layered System
- Code on Demand

### 2.1 Uniform Interface
- It is a key constraints which makes it unique to Non-REST API.
- The idea it that there should be uniform way of interacting with server irrespective of the application

There are four main guildlines needs to be followed:
- **Resource-Based** : Resources are uniquely identified by URIs. Example: /api/features, /api/products
- **Manipulation of Resources Through Representations** : Users get a unique representation of the resouces and contains sufficent information to modify or delete the resouces, provided it has relavent permissions. For example, a user gets a user ID when logged in and can use it to modify or delete its user credentials.
- **Self-descriptive Messages** : Request contains enough information for processing the request.
- **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)** : It need to include links for each response so that client can discover other resources easily.

### 2.2 Stateless 
- Stateless means the request are independent and the server handles each request separately without any pior knowledge of the client. So request must contain all the information to fulfill the request.
- It helps to enable greater availability since the server does not have to maintain, update or communicate that session state.

### 2.3 Cacheable
- Requests are requied to annouce if it is cacheable or not and their duration it can be cached at the client side. This allows the client to return the data from the cache for any subsequent requests and no need of sending requests again to the server.
- It helps to improve performance as it reduces some clientâ€“server interactions.

### 2.4 Client-Server
- REST application requies a client-server architecture.
- Client is the someone who requies resouces and a server is the one who provides the resouces.
  
### 2.5 Layered System
- REST applications are composed of multiple layers without knowing each other except their immediate layer.
- This decouples the client from the backend, enabling scalability and flexibility.
### 2.6 Code on Demand
- The server can send executable code (like JavaScript) to the client, which then can be executed by the client.
- This constraint is optional.
